Let me give you an example:

I have a client John Smith, let's say I have his employment, hospital and education details in front of me and I want to put them in chronological order.
From:
ajay.mani.tripathi

I start with the employment records. They cover the period between 2005 to 2015. I enter the date, description and upload the files as I go. I then move to the hospital records, they cover the period 2000 to 2013, I start recording the date, description and uploading files as I go. Finally I go to education and the records cover the period 1988 to 2005, I enter date and description and upload as I go.
